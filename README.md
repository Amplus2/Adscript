# Adscript
A programming language that will be used for Amplus2/Adscriptum.

## General
### Binary expressions
There probably won't be any binary expressions. Instead,
there will be built-in functions named after generally used
binary operators.

## Built-in functions

### +, -, *, /, %
These functions basically just do what their operator does.

### llvm-ir
Equivalent to the asm "function" in c.

### all c std library functions
As long as you have the c std library on your system, you
probably will be able to use it.
